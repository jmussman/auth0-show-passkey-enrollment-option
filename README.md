# Auth0-Show-Passkey-Enrollment-Option

## Overview

Customer identity cloud scenarios may benefit from passwordless and multi-factor authentication, but in CIC
the user needs to opt-in for this instead of having it forced upon them.
This action is designed to look for the opt-in and check to see if the user is not enrolled with passkeys,
and if not trigger enrollment during the login process.

This is one of a series of action examples that may be used as a foundation for building
what you need.
Search GitHub for *jmussman/auth0* to find other examples in the series.

## Implementation

The implementation looks at the user profile for a 'passkeyOptIn' attribute set to true in the user
metadata.
If the opt-in attribute is set, it checks the authentication methods for the user via the management API.
If passkeys are not set, it triggers passkey enrollment before the login flow proceeds.

Changing the opt-in attribute to false or removing it causes the action to skip the check for passkeys and
triggering enrollment.
The customer portal can clear the passkey registration if the user opts-out.
If the registration is not cleared, it will still work when the user clicks the passkey button
on the login screen, even if they are opted out.
This may be the desired behavior.

## Configuration

This assumes basic knowledge of working with actions and adding actions to flows in Auth0.
This is an overview of the configuration that must be established.

### Steps

1. Create or use an existing M2M application configuration that has read:users and read:authentication_methos permission in the Management API.
2. Create a new post-login action using the code in the *auth0-show-passkey-enrollment-option.js* file.
3. Add the *auth0* Node.js package as a dependency for the action, the current version at this time is 4.4.0.
4. Add secrets for *domain*, *clientId*, and *clientSecret* using the values from the application in step 1.
5. Add a secret *debug* with a value of true for console messages during testing, clear it for production. A re-deployment is neccessary after changing a secret.
6. Save and deploy the action in the post-login flow.

## Unit Tests

Auth0 flow actions provide a rduimentary mechanism for testing.
The custom database actions do not provide a testing feature.
All actions can be monitored for console output using the *Realtime WebTask Logs Extension* in the Auth0 tenant.
When launched by clicking the extension, consent must be provided for it to access the console.
All messages written to console.log will be visible here; a strong recommendation is to only use this in the development sandbox or there will be too many
messages to wade through.

The flow actions testing mechanism allows a mock event to be edited and then the action tested.
Unfortunately, the only way to managem multiple tests with any success is to manage different event configurations outside of the console,
and then paste them in turn to perform tests.

Any significant action must have all possible paths of execution checked, with both positive and negative configurations.
There is no reason that the event and api objects cannot be mocked, and actions tested, outside of Auth0.
As an example of how to do with for a action this project has a full suite of unit tests, written in *Vitest*, with a high percentage of code-coverage.
Vitest performs much better than Jest at asynchromous testing, which is often the case with an action.

### Run the tests in GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=802306992) 

Click the button to open the project in GitHub Codespaces.
Wait for codespaces to open and initialize, watch to see that the *npm install* was run.
In the VSCode Run and Debug panel execute "Run Test" or "Run Test-Coverage".
A new terminal window will open to display the results.

### Run the tests on your own computer

Clone the repository to your local computer.
You will need Node.js installed.
At the command line in the project folder:

* Execute *npm install* to add the Vitest packages.
* Run *npm test* to run all the unit tests
* Run *npm run test-coverage* to run the test suite with code-coverage (currently at 100%).
