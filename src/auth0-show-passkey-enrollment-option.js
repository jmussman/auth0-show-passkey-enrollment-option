 * This Action code is released under the MIT license and is free to copy and modify as

 * 
 * If the user has the passkeyOptIn attribute set to true in the user metadata, this
 * action will check for existing enrollment, and if not present trigger the opt-in
 * enrollment of a passkey before the user moves on.
 * 
 * To configure this a machine-to-machine application needs to be configured in the tenant
 * which will talk to the default 'Auth0 Management API' to make management API requests.
 * The roles required for this application to service this action are 'read:users' and
 * 'read:authentication_methods'. Store the domain and credentials in the Action
 * secrets: 'domain', 'clientId', and 'clientSecret'.
 * 
 * Add a secret value 'debug' of true to enable console logging, remove it to disable
 * console logging. Remember to force a deployment of the action if you change the
 * secret.
 * 
 * Add the 'auth0' Node.js dependency at the latest version (4.4.0 at this time).
